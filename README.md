# Handwritten-Digit-Classifier


## Overview:
----------

* In this project, *Handwritten Digit Classifier*, we will try build a neural network from scratch by using the required algorithms and mathematical functions in order to classify handwritten digit.

* The dataset is provided by *MNIST(Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)*. MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

* The various neural network architectures created in this project are insprised from Michael Nielsen's [Neural Networks and Deep Learning book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html).
